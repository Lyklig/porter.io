        <h2 id="refuses-to-sign-contract">Refuses to sign contract</h2>
        <p>Contracts are key to keeping both parties in check for a project. If the client doesn’t want to sign a contract, ask why. Give them the option to at least look over the contract and ask questions. If you cannot convince the client to sign a contract, then back out immediately. If you’re in dire need of cash flow, then its up to you. Just don’t put too much time and effort on the line. Flyers, cd covers, sub-$100 projects, or projects like that.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Orange Flag - Say no unless you’re broke</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="negativity-towards-past-contractors">Negativity towards past contractors</h2>
        <p>If you don’t have nothing nice to say, then don’t say anything at all. It’s something we’re all trying to learn. So keep that in mind when a potential client starts talking down on their past freelancing contractors. There we're very few projects I took on where the client would talk bad about past designers, but then our relationship would be great. Some green flags: a client talks about the problems with their product or website; the client talks about what a successful project will look like.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Orange Flag - Say no unless you’re broke</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="get-paid-after-revenue-made">Get paid after revenue made</h2>
        <p>Nooooooooooooo. Nooooooooo. Nooooooo. Only businesses you’ll want to do that with are non-profit companies. Other than that, they’re not serious and you should avoid this situation as much as possible.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Red Flag - Just say no</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="doesnt-value-the-industry-or-project">Doesn’t Value The Industry or Project</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, you’ll just run into clients that don’t value design, tech or marketing. I believe that design &amp; tech is important when it comes building a successful brand. Now, there are some verticals that don't care too much about beautiful or future-focused design. Some markets and some target markets don't care much about great design and tech either.</p>
        
        <p>So if you finding yourself having to reschedule a lot of meetings, or wanting to pay way below your rates, it’s not a match. Make sure you do research on you that lead before deciding. If the lead tends to blow more budget on other efforts and the website looks really bad, watch out. This client has money, but not for a website. You could probably sell them harder on good design, the costs of it &amp; why its great for business. Most of the time, it just doesn't work out.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Red Flag - Just say no</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="bad-with-communication-and-time-management">Bad With Communication and Time Management</h2>
        <p>I’ve work with certain clients where I’m rescheduling the first meeting every week. Its obvious that this client either puts this task low priority or the client is just bad with management.</p>
        
        <p>Some green flags to look for before signing on the client are quick responses, within 48 hrs of receipt. The potential client reads your full email and answers questions you've asked. There's really good spelling and grammar. The potential client calls at the times you've created or call you at the times you designated. This client respects your time. Find that client!</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Red Flag - Just say no</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="can-you-copy-this-website">Can you copy this website?</h2>
        <p>I love when clients want to copy a website in full. Even if its not a straight copy, they still would want to copy the direction of the content and design. Usually when you run into those type of clients, they usually just want something quick and dirty. Now choosing to work with a quick and dirty client is your choice. Usually quick and dirty clients are entrepreneurs that are bootstraped, or spending their own money.</p>
        
        <p>If your client base is those types, then you're in luck. Just sell them on the fact that you don't have to copy the site, but just "steal" certain elements, such as why the competitor chooses to use a certain type of shot in their photography or why they'll have the login feature in one area of the site.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Yellow Flag - Sleep On It</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="the-project-management-triangle-abuse">The Project Management Triangle Abuse</h2>
        <p>The best client in the world. "Can I get a high quality product for low cost in a short period of time?" O…hold up! You can only pick two out of the three. If you're familiar with the Project Management Triangle, its basically a model on constaints for choosing a project. The project can only take a hit from two out of three corners, "Quality/Scope", "Time" &amp; "Cost".</p>
        
        <p>So if a client needs a website below your rate and needs it yesterday, then the quality/scope will be lacking. If the client needs a website with a lot of features and needed it yesterday, then its going to come at a cost. If the client needs a website with a lot of features and only has a few bucks to throw down, then plan on having the deadline of launch in three months and not one month.</p>
        
        <p>Experience is the only way of knowing what parts of the triangle the client is using. Only you will know if the client has a lot of features, under-paying you or getting you to deliver in record speeds. Just know when a client wants all three corners from the triangle. That's a straight no no.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Yellow Flag - Sleep On It</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="client-is-not-a-designer-at-all-but-good-at-photoshop">Client is not a designer, at all, but "good" at Photoshop</h2>
        <p>When you get the client that tries to do your work, you have a micro-manager. The only people that can get away with this are Product managers, designers and developers. Now if this client knocks their wireframes out the park and you're like…"Holy shit", then of course, I would work with them. If they're not making any sense, there's no research done, no insight. Just, I like this because this is what I like. What? Huh? Who? Where? If you became lost after a client shows their Photoshop mockups of what they want, then fall back.i</p>
