## Refuses to sign contract
Contracts are key to keeping both parties in check for a project. If the client doesn’t want to sign a contract, ask why. Give them the option to at least look over the contract and ask questions. If you cannot convince the client to sign a contract, then back out immediately. If you’re in dire need of cash flow, then its up to you. Just don’t put too much time and effort on the line.

## Negativity towards past contractors
If you don’t have nothing nice to say, then don’t say anything at all. It’s something we’re all trying to learn. So keep that in mind when a potential lead starts talking down on their past contractors.  Some green flags: a lead talks about the problems with their product or website; the lead talks about what a successful project will look like.

## Get paid after revenue made
Nooooooooooooo. Nooooooooo. Nooooooo. Only folks you’ll want to do that with are non-profit companies. Other than that, they’re not serious and you should avoid this situation as much as possible.

## Doesn’t Value The Industry or Project
Sometimes, you’ll just run into leads and clients that don’t value design or development. I believe that design and good tech is important when it comes to your brand and business. If you finding yourself having to reschedule a lot of meetings, it’s not a match. Spending more dough on vacations and nightlife (thanks Instagram), yep, they rather have the prebuilt solution with low quality.

## Bad With Communication and Time Management
I’ve work with certain leads where I’m rescheduling the first meeting every week. I’m like, look, I have other things to tackle. Its obvious that this lead either puts this task low priority or is just bad with management. Move on.
