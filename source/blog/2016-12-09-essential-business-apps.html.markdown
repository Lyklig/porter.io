When you're freelancing, consulting or running a small business, you have to be about that business. Making sure your business is making money and not losing money is number 1. That's how you keep the business up. To make money, you have to have customers and treating those customers well. To have customers you have to go out in the world and get them. A lot to manage, huh?

With all that in mind, you have to stay organized as hell or shit is going to fall apart, quick! Here's what I do. I use different tools to handle all that. So below, I listed all those tools below. Try that shit out and see if it works for you. If not, Google the titles like "Time Management App" and find an alternative. [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) also works for looking for some good apps to use. Here we go:

## Time Management & Invoicing: Harvest
Pricing: $0/$12/$49/$99 per month  
[https://www.getharvest.com/](https://www.getharvest.com/)

### How this helps me:
- Track how much time I spend on billable and non-billable projects. This is key to finding out what the hell I'm doing all day.
- Evidence of time spent for clients. Clients will always be suspect of the time you spend working. That's why they rather have you work at their office. Sending these will help ease the pain.
- Send invoices to my clients and connect my [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com) and [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com) accounts so clients can easily pay their balance.
