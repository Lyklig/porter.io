Whenever you are about to stop working and start Tweeting, catch yourself and close your eyes.  Take a few deep breaths and then breath for about five minutes. During this time, focus on your breath. When a though pops up, recognize it and then take a deep breath. You might feel a tingle in your head. That's a good thing.

I try to do this as much as possible because we're taking in so much information. The era is still young, the age of information. Our brain is still getting used to this, so we have to take it easy. Doing this exercise could slow down your anxiety. It could help you catch negative thoughts before you slide into depression.

I also do this as I struggle with a lot of anxiety and depression. My mind is always creating and analyzing. My mind is always on. Meditation has help me reduce my anxiety, but letting me sit in the moment. When I can calm my mind down, I can process things easier. Its like having a bunch of papers on your desk. You can't concentrate. When the desk is clean, you can actually breath a little and get things done, efficiently and effectively.

This is how you can start to learn meditation. Take 5 minutes during those down times or breaks to close your eyes and breath. It's going to be ok.
